# Introduction

This is the solution for the third exam of the Machine Learning with Python Certification from FreeCode Camp.
I copied the boilerplate code from https://colab.research.google.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-book-recommendation-engine/blob/master/fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb#scrollTo=jd2SLCh8oxMh

When I got stuck with the test (my problem was the order of title and distance plus I had one recommendation too many I took a glance on https://colab.research.google.com/github/a-mt/fcc-book-recommendation-knn/blob/main/fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb#scrollTo=f5ZUd-L1SQz7)

I find my solution super uggly to be honest, but it does the trick to pass the exercise.
